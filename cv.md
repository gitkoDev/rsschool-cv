### About

I am a 24-year-old English teacher, born in Russia but currently living in the South of China. I'm ready for relocation. My passion for teaching was what inspired me to learn coding and create games for my English classes.

I'm extremely interested in creating useful web applications for solving various problems.

My long-term goal is making a unique portfolio and projects that would help me land my first frontend/fullstack web developer job.
